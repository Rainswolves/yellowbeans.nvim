# yellowbeans.nvim
This is a dependencyless neovim theme similar to jellybeans but with yellow as the main theme color. The theme is written in lua. The theme is intentionally made to only include highlight groups for the most essential parts of the ui which has the benefit of making it very lightweight. If there are any highlight groups you want added, feel free to pull request or contact me.
